title:  "Quora Better Notifications"
subtitle: "A Chrome Extension that will improve Quora Notifications"
excerpt: "I have been really frustrated with the default Quora notifications page. Hundreds of new notifications everyday, lots of them are redundant (i.e. the same question added to several topics i follow or x number of people added an answer to a question i follow). And its not only me, i have recently read A typical day on Quora for me, or why notifications need to be burned before they lay eggs and that actually what sparked the urge in me to develop something in the weekend to solve not only what i thought my problem, but apparently a wide-agreed-upon one"
