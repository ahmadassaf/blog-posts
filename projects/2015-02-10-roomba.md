title:  "Roomba - OpenData Checker"
subtitle: "A Node.js tool to examine the correctness of Open Data Metadata and build custom dataset profiles"
excerpt: "Linked Open Data (LOD) has emerged as one of the largest collection of interlinked datasets on the web. Benefiting from this mine of data requires the existence of descriptive information about each dataset in the accompanying metadata. Such meta information is currently very limited to few data portals where they are usually provided manually thus giving little or bad quality insights. To address this issue, we propose a scalable automatic approach for extracting, validating and generating descriptive linked dataset profiles"
